#Akan names
This is a simple program that can tell you what day of the week you were born just by filling in a number of details  i.e year of birth,month of birth and the date of birth then this will automatically calculate what day of the week you were born and also assign you an Akan name because the Akan community actually names children after days of the week they were born
